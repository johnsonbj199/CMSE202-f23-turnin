    "**&#9989; Question 7.2 (1 point):** If you explore the various accuracies you end up getting for the various combinations of learning rate and number of iterations, you'd probably notice that there are a number of combinations that give you the same accuracy. This suggests that perhaps the Perceptron classifier is not finding a \"converged\" solution. As a reminder, the Perceptron classifier will only converge if the data is linearly separable. Do you think the sonar dataset is linearly separable? Why or why not? (You can use some of your experience with the SVC model to help you answer this question.)"
